Frontpagetext: Hidden away, beneath old newspapers, books of stamps and expectant sellotape lie the best pieces of work. They are the Darlings. The stories, the ornaments, the gems we are told to cut. It's a rule of writing passed around like an illegal cigarette. You must murder your darlings. Producers, script writers, authors, editors have all had the rule thrown at them. These scenes may be fantastically written, funny, evocative…but they don’t belong, they obscure the plot, blind us from the truth. But what if these anecdotes had a programme to themselves? What if you could bring those Darlings back to life ?
