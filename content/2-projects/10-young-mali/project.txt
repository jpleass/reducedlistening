Frontpagetext: In October 2011 Lucy Duran travelled to Mali in West Africa to meet rapper Amkoullel and hear the music of young Malians. On the streets of Bamako she met and recorded musicians from Bambara, Fulani and Bobo ethnic groups, all of whom are drawing on their traditional roots and making music for the future. She attended the musical wedding parties that spread all over the city each weekend, the informal street discussions called Grins where young men discuss politics, music and local gossip, and went cassette shopping to find out how music piracy is affecting young musicians.
